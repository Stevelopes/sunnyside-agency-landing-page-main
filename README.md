This is a solution to the [Sunnyside agency landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef). 


Hi my name is Steven Lopes, this is my first frontend mentor challenge. I recently done a introductory 60hr course to learn frontend web development where i learned HTML, CSS and Javascript.
## Table of contents

- [Overview](#overview)

Overall i'm pretty happy with how i done, i mean i know that there is proberly alot i can do better on, i really like using css. plus it is the first time using scss, which is alot faster and cleaner.

- [The challenge](#the-challenge)

The challenge for me was little things really, adding scss link into HTML instead of css got me stumped for a good 20mins. 
Also trying to reuse class names for other content would mess everything up but i liked trying to solve it.

So i looked over the design and wrote down how many column and rows i'd need for both mobile and desktop then i proceeded to start writing the HTML once i was satisfied with how it looked i then used SCSS to start styling for mobile first then desktop
